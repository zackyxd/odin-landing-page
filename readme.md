This project by TOP will showcase the skills I have learned so far in the HTML/CSS course. It will mimic and existing website layout shown in expected_layout.png

After completion:
This project taught me how to use flexbox for how to organize the website nicely. I had a few troubles with doing that and had to look at some references. The hardest part was figuring out how to center everything in the middle. Maybe having a default case for flex and flex direction being column would have worked?
